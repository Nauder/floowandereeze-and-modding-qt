## Features

- Unity asset texture extraction and manipulation, including:
  - Card Art
  - Card Face
  - Card Sleeve
  - Duel Field
  - Home Background
  - Home Wallpaper
  - Player Icon
- Card name and description editing
- Customizable compression and mipmap count for created assets

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- Python 3.8 or later
- Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel installed with the in-game download

## Installation

For end-user documentation, refer to the [documentation](docs/README.md).

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nauder/floowandereeze-and-modding-qt.git
    cd floowandereeze-and-modding-qt
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the development environment:

```powershell
.\dev.ps1
```

This script will:

- Activate the virtual environment
- Compile Qt UI files and resources using `build_qt.ps1`
- Launch the application

Note: The `build_qt.ps1` script is used to:

- Compile Qt resource files (`.qrc`) into Python modules
- Convert Qt Designer UI files (`.ui`) into Python code
- These steps are necessary for the application to run properly

```

## Development

- The project uses PySide6 for the GUI, with Pyside Designer ui files
- SQLAlchemy for database operations
- UnityPy for Unity asset handling
- Various other utilities for file processing and data manipulation
- Currently, development is focused on Windows, as that is the main supported desktop OS for Master Duel

## Building

To create a standalone executable:

```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

This script will:

1. Compile Qt UI files and resources using `build_qt.ps1`
2. Create a single-file executable using PyInstaller
3. Include necessary dependencies and UnityPy assets
4. Generate the executable in the `dist` directory
